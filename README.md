EShop
=====

Small shopping app prototype

Notes
-----
Then I started I wanted to use ebay api so I found required methods and
started to hack with it, using stub. As I moved to the real api usage
I found that EBay requires some amount of work around auth, and it's
documentation is WORST DOCUMENTATION EVER. Even example code links
wasn't working. I've spent many hours looking for appropriate solution
but failed.

The only functionality implemented so far is search, but since API is
stub it doesn't really searches anything, but gets all dataset stabbed.
